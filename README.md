[pdf.js][pdf.js] is a Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5, which makes it easily integrable with other web based technologies. In the current project it is used as the pdf-viewer. It is community-driven and supported by Mozilla Labs. 

[BioStar][biostar] is a [Python][python] and [Django][django] based Q&A software which is built on the popular stackoverflow model. It is integrated into the platform to allow questions and answers in the context of scientific articles.
